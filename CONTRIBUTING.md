# Contributing to local-onenote-mcp

> **Project philosophy:** This repository is intentionally a tiny, focused MCP server. Keep changes lightweight, avoid adding unnecessary dependencies, and prefer minimal implementations with clear benefits. When proposing improvements, ask "Does this keep the server simple and stable?" before proceeding.


Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide will get you set up quickly.

## Prerequisites

(This list is intentionally short; the goal is a low barrier to entry.)

- Windows 10/11
- Microsoft OneNote Desktop (2016 / 2019 / 365) **open and running**
- Python 3.10+
- PowerShell 5.1+

## Dev Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/biladiz/local-onenote-mcp
cd local-onenote-mcp
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt
# optional dev deps for tests/lint
.venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Project Layout

```
onenote_pro_mcp_ps.py   # FastMCP server — persistent subprocess manager + tool definitions
onenote_bridge.ps1      # PowerShell bridge — all OneNote COM calls, JSON I/O, loop mode
```

## Architecture

```
MCP Client ──stdio──▸ onenote_pro_mcp_ps.py ──stdin/stdout JSON──▸ onenote_bridge.ps1 [-Loop] ──COM──▸ OneNote
```

The Python server starts the PS bridge **once** with `-Loop` at startup. Every tool call sends a single-line JSON command and reads a single-line JSON response — no per-call subprocess spawning.

## Testing Manually

**Test the bridge directly (single-shot mode):**
```powershell
# List local notebooks
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File onenote_bridge.ps1 -Cmd list

# List pages in a section
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File onenote_bridge.ps1 -Cmd listpages -P1 "MyNotebook" -P2 "MySection"
```

**Test the loop mode:**
```powershell
echo '{"cmd":"list","p1":"","p2":"","p3":""}' | powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File onenote_bridge.ps1 -Loop
```

## Adding a New Tool

1. **Add a PS command** — add a new `"commandname"` case inside `Invoke-Cmd` in `onenote_bridge.ps1`. Always call `Send-Ok` or `Send-Err`.
2. **Add a Python tool** — add a `@mcp.tool()` decorated function in `onenote_pro_mcp_ps.py` that calls `run_command("commandname", ...)`.
3. **Update the README** — add the new tool to the Features table.

## Code Style

- **Python**: formatted with `ruff format`, linted with `ruff check`. Run: `ruff check . && ruff format --check .`
- **PowerShell**: analysed with `PSScriptAnalyzer`. Run: `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path onenote_bridge.ps1`

## Submitting a PR

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`
2. Make your changes and test manually against OneNote
3. Open a Pull Request with a clear description of what you changed and why

## Reporting Issues

Please include:
- Your OneNote version (File → Account → About OneNote)
- Your Windows version (`winver`)
- The exact error message from the MCP client or from running the bridge manually
